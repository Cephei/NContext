NContext is an extensible, composable application framework for .NET 4.0.

This project is a culmination and on-going effort of research over the subject. It borrows many patterns, implementations, concepts from a variety of software architects in the field. NContext is unique and innovative in how it allows you to design your application without tying it down to any specific technology or pattern. It also introduces new concepts in designing your domain(s). With few dependencies, and broken into additional add-on modules for things like: Entity Framework, Enterprise Library, and WCF, NContext is dependency-injection container agnostic. Unity support has been added with the intentions of supporting all popular containers in the near future.
