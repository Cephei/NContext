NContext
========

NContext is an application composition framework for .NET 4.0.

This project is an on-going architectural research effort. It borrows many
ideas, patterns, and concepts from a variety of software architects in the
field. NContext is unique and innovative in how it allows you to design your
application without tying it down to any specific technology or architectural
pattern.

It also introduces new concepts in designing your bounded-contexts. With few
core dependencies, NContext's highly-extensible design allows for custom add-on
modules for things like: Entity Framework, Enterprise Library, and ASP.NET Web
API.

NContext is dependency-injection container agnostic. Ninject and Unity support
has been added with the intentions of supporting all popular containers in the
near future.
