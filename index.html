<p>NContext is an application composition framework for .NET 4 &amp; 4.5.</p>

<p>This project is an on-going architectural research effort. It borrows many
ideas, patterns, and concepts from a variety of software architects in the
field. NContext is unique and innovative in how it allows you to design your
application without tying it down to any specific technology or architectural
pattern.</p>

<p>At it's core, NContext introduces two fundamental concepts: dynamic application
composition (bootstrapping) based upon MEF and IResponseTransferObject - a DTO
which allows you to create a functionally composable application codebase. With 
it, the idea of Functional Domain Composition.</p>

<p>It also introduces new concepts in designing your bounded-contexts. With few
core dependencies, NContext's highly-extensible design allows for custom add-on
modules. Already built extensions include: Entity Framework, ASP.NET Web API &amp; 
OWIN, AutoMapper, Value Injecter, and Logging. Some application components have 
been baked into NContext including: Caching, Security, Cryptography.</p>

<p>NContext is dependency-injection container agnostic. Ninject and Unity support
has been added with the intentions of supporting all popular containers in the
near future.</p>

<p>Currently, NContext is being deployed on-demand to reduce development costs. As new feature and bug fixes are brought into the framework and tested, the CI servers are spun-up and deployments are done from the following sites. Pre-release versions are currently deployed to official Nuget/Symbol Source servers. I don't recommend relying on these CI servers for any builds as they aren't live 24/7.</p>

<p><strong>CI TeamCity Server:</strong> <em><a href="https://teamcity.wakingventure.com">https://teamcity.wakingventure.com</a></em><br><strong>CI NuGet Package Source:</strong> <em><a href="https://nuget.wakingventure.com">https://nuget.wakingventure.com</a></em><br><strong>CI Symbol Source Server:</strong> <em><a href="http://symbolsource.wakingventure.com">http://symbolsource.wakingventure.com</a></em>  </p>

<p>NContext versioning is still being determined. The core libraries (NContext.dll &amp; 
NContext.Common.dll) will be released as 2.x.0. Ideally all extensions will be 
independently versioned, however, the current build process does not reflect this. 
This will be addressed in future builds as updating NuGet references is currently a 
pain since each build packages a new NuGet release for every .nuspec.</p>
